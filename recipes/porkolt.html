    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs. beef</li>
        <li>1 large white onion</li>
        <li>3 oz. fat or butter</li>
        <li>3 tbs. ground paprika</li>
        <li>4 cups stock or broth</li>
        <li>salt </li>
        <li>ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>heat fat over medium heat in large stew-pot</li>
        <li>slice onion in half and slice each half into thin half-rings, and saute in the melted fat.</li> 
        <li>add salt and pepper</li>
        <li>while onion is cooking stir occasionally and cube the beef. a moderate amount of fat is desireable to don't trim</li>
        <li>once the onion has browned and is very soft add the cubed beef and enough stock to cover it</li>
        <li>add half of the paprika and black pepper to taste </li>
        <li> bring the pot to a simmer and cover</li>
        <li>our goal is extremely tender meat and a thick sauce so uncover and begin reducing the stock when the meat is abuot 2/3s done </li>
        <li>after reducing 90% of the liquid add the remaining paprika and salt and pepper to taste </li>
        <li>continue to cook uncovered until sauce is thick and meat is tender</li>
        
    </ol>
