            <p>I don't know why this is called "jewish" rice, it is definitely not kosher, but it is very satisfying and very easy.  
                I have tried many substitution and additions and they generally work but I would not recommend anything but basmati rice.</p>
        </div>

    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li> 8oz of fresh sliced mushrooms (canned are fine)</li>
